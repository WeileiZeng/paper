                  limit. The striking features in the transport
                  characteristics result from breakdown of the integer
                  quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and thermionic emission
                  of hot electrons in the inversion layer of GaAs to
                  the bypass layer of AlxGa1-xAs. In narrow-channel
                  devices, we observe a series of pronounced steps in
                  the longitudinal resistance as a function of current
                  or magnetic field. We show that these steps
                  originate from localized breakdowns of the IQHE at
                  different sections of the sample. (The nature of
                  these steps was previously incorrectly attributed in

                  of a strong negative differential resistance,
                  realized exclusively at high magnetic fields. It
                  results from an interplay between a real-space
                  transfer of hot electrons in GaAs into the
                  AlxGa1-xAs layer and the IQHE due to the cold

                  cyclotron frequency which becomes zero at the

                  become holons (charge Q=1, spin S/sub 3/=0), which

                  a transverse kink (or antikink) of the domain
                  wall. This gives rise to two holon flavors and to a

                  decoherence. Methods such as nuclei polarization,

                  and led to several algorithms that substantially
                  reduce exponential complexity of this task. However,
                  no asymptotic complexity bounds are known for
                  distance verification in other ensembles of linear

                  complexity for LDPC codes. We obtain new complexity

                  of the erasure-correcting thresholds of long LDPC

                  general linear codes are first applied to the
                  quantum stabilizer codes. Then, these techniques are
                  considered for classical and quantum (stabilizer)
                  low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes. New
                  complexity bounds for distance verification with
                  provable performance are derived using the average
                  weight spectra of the ensembles of LDPC codes. These
                  bounds are expressed in terms of the
                  erasure-correcting capacity of the corresponding
                  ensemble. We also present a new irreducible-cluster
                  technique that can be applied to any LDPC code and
                  takes advantage of parity-checks' sparsity for both

                  this case is monitored via time-averaged

                  logical error rate for several models of
                  decoherence, and also find the termination rate for
                  this quantum error detecting code. The code
                  operation is comparable to that based on projective
                  measurements when the collapse timescale due to
                  continuous measurements is an order of magnitude
                  less than the time period between the projective
                  measurements. An advantage of the

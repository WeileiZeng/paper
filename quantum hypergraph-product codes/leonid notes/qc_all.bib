                  can be in a superposition of states and

                  frequency is close to a continuum edge of the
                  reservoir spectrum. This strong-coupling regime is
                  outside the scope of existing methods of decay or
                  decoherence control. We demonstrate that an
                  appropriate sequence of nearly abrupt changes of the
                  resonance frequency can protect the qubit state from
                  decay and decoherence more effectively than the
                  intuitively obvious alternative, which is to fix the
                  resonance well within a forbidden band gap of the
                  reservoir spectrum, as far as possible from the
                  continuum edge. The "counterintuitive" nonadiabatic
                  method outlined here can outperform its adiabatic
                  counterparts in maintaining a high fidelity of
                  quantum logic operations. The remarkable

                  much lower rates of frequency changes than

                  ability of appropriately alternating detunings from

                  particular emphasis on using only physically
                  relevant interactions. A necessary and sufficient
                  condition for the existence of decoherence-free
                  (noiseless) subsystems in the Markovian regime is
                  derived here for the first time. A stabilizer
                  formalism for DFSs is then developed which allows
                  for the explicit understanding of these in their
                  dual role as quantum error correcting
                  codes. Conditions for the existence of Hamiltonians
                  whose induced evolution always preserves a DFS are
                  derived within this stabilizer formalism. Two
                  possible collective decoherence mechanisms arising
                  from permutation symmetries of the system-bath
                  coupling are examined within this framework. It is
                  shown that in both cases universal quantum
                  computation which always preserves the DFS (natural
                  fault-tolerant computation) can be performed using
                  only two-body interactions. This is in marked
                  contrast to standard error correcting codes, where
                  all known constructions using one- or two-body
                  interactions must leave the code space during the
                  on-time of the fault-tolerant gates. A further
                  consequence of our universality construction is that
                  a single exchange Hamiltonian can be used to perform
                  universal quantum computation on an encoded space
                  whose asymptotic coding efficiency is unity. The
                  exchange Hamiltonian, which is naturally present in
                  many quantum systems, is thus asymptotically
                  universal.}

                  electrode connected to a reservoir via a Josephson
                  junction constitutes an artificial two-level
                  electronic system: a single-Cooper-pair box. The two
                  levels consist of charge states (differing by 2e,
                  where e is the electronic charge) that are coupled
                  by tunnelling of Cooper pairs through the
                  junction. Although the two-level system is
                  macroscopic, containing a large number of electrons,
                  the two charge states can be coherently
                  superposed. The Cooper-pair box has therefore been
                  suggested as a candidate for a quantum bit or
                  'qubit'—the basic component of a quantum
                  computer. Here we report the observation of quantum
                  oscillations in a single-Cooper-pair box. By
                  applying a short voltage pulse via a gate electrode,
                  we can control the coherent quantum state evolution:
                  the pulse modifies the energies of the two charge
                  states non-adiabatically, bringing them into
                  resonance. The resulting state—a superposition of
                  the two charge states—is detected by a tunnelling
                  current through a probe junction. Our results
                  demonstrate electrical coherent control of a qubit
                  in a solid-state electronic device. }

Alice has made a decision in her mind. While she does not want to reveal it to Bob at this moment, she would like to convince Bob that she is committed to this particular decision and that she cannot change it at a later time. Is there a way to get Bob's trust?

This practical question is also one of the fundamental dilemmas of quantum cryptography, and is discussed in this fascinating and highly topical volume. In addition, experimental realizations and theoretical aspects of trapped-ion and other possible quantum computers are presented in detail.

Still a number of years ahead, quantum computers will possibly shape the 21st century as much as conventional computers shaped the 20th century. This volume provides you with up-to-date information on the current state of the art in this rapidly advancing field.

                  pp. 124--134] suggesting that quantum computers are
                  more powerful than classical probabilistic
                  computers. Following Shor's result that factoring
                  and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both
                  solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural
                  to ask whether all of $\NP$ can be efficiently
                  solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we
                  address this question by proving that relative to an
                  oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1
                  the class $\NP$ cannot be solved on a quantum Turing
                  machine (QTM) in time $o(2^{n/2})$. We also show
                  that relative to a permutation oracle chosen
                  uniformly at random with probability 1 the class
                  $\NP \cap \coNP$ cannot be solved on a QTM in time
                  $o(2^{n/3})$. The former bound is tight since recent
                  work of Grover [in {\it Proc.\ $28$th Annual ACM
                  Symposium Theory Comput.}, 1996] shows how to accept
                  the class $\NP$ relative to any oracle on a quantum
                  computer in time

                  by strongly modulating the systemÇs dynamics to average
                  out unwanted evolution. With the aid of numerical search
                  methods, pulsed irradiation schemes are obtained that
                  perform accurate, arbitrary, selective gates on multiqubit
                  systems. Compared to low power selective pulses, which
                  cannot average out all unwanted evolution, these pulses are
                  substantially shorter in time, thereby reducing the effects
                  of relaxation. Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
                  techniques on homonuclear spin systems are used to
                  demonstrate the accuracy of these gates both in simulation
                  and experiment. Simulations of the coherent evolution of a
                  three-qubit system show that the control sequences
                  faithfully implement the unitary operations, typically
                  yielding gate fidelities on the order of 0.999 and, for some
                  sequences, up to 0.9997. The experimentally determined
                  density matrices resulting from the application of different
                  control sequences on a three-spin system have overlaps of up
                  to 0.99 with the expected states, confirming the quality of
                  the experimental implementation.}

                  includes constraints on the time behavior of

                  algorithm by introducing a quadruple space that
                  consists of a direct product of the double

                  time-dependent constraints, the algorithm
                  represented in the quadruple-space notation reduces
                  to that of the double-space notation. This

                  often experimental systems have three or more energy
                  levels. In a Josephson phase qubit the energy
                  differences between successive levels differ by only
                  a few percent, and hence care must be taken to
                  isolate the two desired levels from the remaining

                  quantum computation relies on the application of
                  one- and two-qubit gates in order to implement a
                  universal set of logic gates, as well as other
                  gates. Such ideas stem from the notion that the
                  Hamiltonians available for quantum computation are
                  one or two-body processes. However, present day NMR
                  implementations of quantum information processing
                  (QIP) rely on the internal Hamiltonian of a liquid
                  state system in which there are many two-body
                  processes that occur simultaneously. Such use of the
                  internal Hamiltonian allows for the creation of
                  `multiqubit' logic gates, i.e. logic gates that

                  larger qubit operations offer a universal set of
                  gates (even when not all couplings within the

                  circuit implementation of the smallest
                  error-correcting code (the three bit code). Quantum
                  circuits are physically implemented by serial
                  pulses, i.e., by switching on and off external
                  parameters in the Hamiltonian one after another. In
                  contrast to this, we introduce a parallel switching
                  method which allows faster gate operation by
                  switching all external parameters simultaneously,
                  and which has potential applications for arbitrary

                   for surface
                  codes Cs and color codes Cc in several instances. On the

                  Cc=3, but we find that the optimal
                  values are Cs=1 and Cc=9. For planar
                  codes, a typical value is Cs=2, while we find that the
                  optimal values are Cs=1 and Cc=3. In

                  is a func- tion of the parameters of the specifc
                  proper code used.  We present two explicit classes
                  of proper quantum codes. The first class generalizes
                  classical secret shar- ing with polynomials. The
                  codes are defined over a field with p elements,
                  which means that the elemen- tary quantum particle
                  is not a qubit but a â€œqupitâ€. The second class uses
                  a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a
                  proper code.  We estimate the threshold qO to be =
                  10-6. Hope- fully, this paper motivates a search for
                  proper quantum codes with higher thresholds, at
                  which point quantum computation becomes practical.}

                  [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 237902 (2002)] have obtained a
                  set of powerful results characterizing the

                  using a fixed interaction Hamiltonian and fast local

                  theoretical calculations. The size and correlation

                  to exhibit temporal electronic
                  correlations. Although there is ample experimental
                  evidence that such correlations exist, electron
                  dynamics in engineered nanostructures have been
                  observed directly only on long timescales. The
                  faster dynamics associated with electrical currents
                  or charge fluctuations are usually inferred from
                  direct (or quasi-direct) current
                  measurements. Recently, interest in electron
                  dynamics has risen, in part owing to the realization
                  that additional information about electronic
                  interactions can be found in the shot noise or
                  higher statistical moments of a direct
                  current. Furthermore, interest in quantum
                  computation has stimulated investigation of quantum
                  bit (qubit) readout techniques, which for many
                  condensed-matter systems ultimately reduces to
                  single-shot measurements of individual electronic
                  charges. Here we report real-time observation of
                  individual electron tunnelling events in a quantum
                  dot using an integrated radio-frequency
                  single-electron transistor. We use electron counting
                  to measure directly the quantum dot's tunnelling
                  rate and the occupational probabilities of its
                  charge state. Our results provide evidence in favour
                  of long (10 µs or more) inelastic scattering times
                  in nearly isolated dots. }

                  by using a set of rapidly thermal-relaxing
                  bits. Such auxiliary bits could be implemented by
                  using spins that rapidly get into thermal

                  spins. Interestingly, the interaction with the

                  behaviour arising from superposition states or
                  entanglement efficiently into the classical language
                  of conventional computers. The solution to this
                  problem, proposed in 1982 (ref. 1), is simulating
                  the quantum behaviour of interest in a different
                  quantum system where the interactions can be
                  controlled and the outcome detected sufficiently
                  well. Here we study the building blocks for
                  simulating quantum spin Hamiltonians with trapped
                  ions2. We experimentally simulate the adiabatic
                  evolution of the smallest non-trivial spin system
                  from paramagnetic into ferromagnetic order with a
                  quantum magnetization for two spins of 98%. We prove
                  that the transition is not driven by thermal
                  fluctuations but is of quantum-mechanical origin
                  (analogous to quantum fluctuations in quantum phase
                  transitions3). We observe a final superposition
                  state of the two degenerate spin configurations for
                  the ferromagnetic order (|â†‘â†‘+|â†“â†“), corresponding to
                  deterministic entanglement achieved with 88%
                  fidelity. This method should allow for scaling to a

                  dephasing by multipulse control. The formula is free

                  in terms of the correlation function of an arbitrary
                  system-reservoir interaction. We first apply the
                  formula to a phenomenological two-level model where
                  the correlation function of the interaction decays
                  exponentially. In this case, we show analytically
                  that the pure dephasing time is effectively
                  lengthened by the multipulse control. Secondly, we
                  apply the formula to the spin-boson model where a
                  spin interacts nonlinearly with a boson

                  information processing (QIP) is driving the pursuit
                  for its practical realization by various physical
                  techniques. Currently, nuclear magnetic resonance
                  (NMR) has been the forerunner by demonstrating a
                  majority of quantum algorithms. In NMR, spin-systems
                  consisting of coupled nuclear spins are utilized as
                  qubits. In order to carry out QIP, a spin-system has
                  to meet two major requirements: (i) qubit
                  addressability and (ii) mutual coupling among
                  the. qubits. It has been demonstrated that the
                  magnitude of the mutual coupling among qubits can be
                  increased by orienting the spin-systems in a liquid
                  crystal matrix and utilizing the residual dipolar
                  couplings. While utilizing residual dipolar
                  couplings may be useful to increase the number of
                  qubits, nuclei of the same species (homonuclei)
                  might become strongly coupled. In strongly coupled
                  spin-systems, spins lose their individual identity
                  of being qubits. We propose that even such strongly
                  coupled spin-systems can be used for QIP and the
                  qubit-manipulation can be achieved by
                  transition-selective pulses. We demonstrate
                  experimental preparation of pseudopure states,

                  criteria were examined and numerical guidelines were
                  assessed. Using a field strength of 7.0 T, protons
                  require a coupling constant of 4 Hz with a chemical
                  shift separation of 0.3 ppm, whereas carbon needs a
                  coupling constant of 25 Hz for a chemical shift
                  difference of 10 ppm, based on the minimal coupling
                  approximation. Using these guidelines, it was
                  determined that 2,3-dibromothiophene is limited to
                  only two qubits; the three qubit system
                  bromotrifluoroethene could be expanded to five

                  by removing rotational degeneracies in addition to
                  introducing specific conformational preferences that
                  could increase (or decrease) the magnitude of the

                  their current successes, limitations and
                  potential. NMR spectroscopy is well known for its
                  wealth of diverse coherent manipulations of spin
                  dynamics. Ideas and instrumentation from liquid
                  state NMR spectroscopy have been used to experiment
                  with QIP. This approach has carried the field to a
                  complexity of about 10 qubits, a small number for
                  quantum computation but large enough for observing
                  and better understanding the complexity of the
                  quantum world. While liquid state NMR is the only
                  present-day technology about to reach this number of
                  qubits, further increases in complexity will require
                  new methods. We sketch one direction leading towards
                  a scalable quantum computer using spin 1/2
                  particles. The next step of which is a solid state

                  from proton magnetization enhances and equalizes

                  schemes. First, we discuss an optimal quantum
                  circuit implementation of the smallest
                  error-correcting code (the three bit code). Quantum
                  circuits are physically implemented by serial
                  pulses, i.e., by switching on and off external
                  parameters in the Hamiltonian one after another. In
                  contrast to this, we introduce a parallel switching

                  allows a qubit to be encoded. When localized in a
                  gate-defined quantum dot, the electron spin provides
                  a promising platform for a future functional quantum
                  computer. The essential ingredient of any quantum
                  computer is entanglementâ€”for the case of
                  electron-spin qubits considered hereâ€”commonly
                  achieved via the exchange interaction. Nevertheless,
                  there is an immense challenge as to how to scale the
                  system up to include many qubits. In this paper, we
                  propose a novel architecture of a large-scale
                  quantum computer based on a realization of
                  long-distance quantum gates between electron spins
                  localized in quantum dots. The crucial ingredients
                  of such a long-distance coupling are floating
                  metallic gates that mediate electrostatic coupling
                  over large distances. We show, both analytically and
                  numerically, that distant electron spins in an array
                  of quantum dots can be coupled selectively, with
                  coupling strengths that are larger than the
                  electron-spin decay and with switching times on the
                  order of nanoseconds.}

                  quantum computing devices are many and varied. They
                  each have unique noise processes that make none of
                  them fully reliable at this time. There are several
                  error correction/avoidance techniques which are
                  valuable for reducing or eliminating errors, but not
                  one, alone, will serve as a panacea. One must
                  therefore take advantage of the strength of each of
                  these techniques so that we may extend the coherence
                  times of the quantum systems and create more
                  reliable computing devices. To this end we give a
                  general strategy for using dynamical decoupling
                  operations on encoded subspaces. These encodings may
                  be of any form; of particular importance are
                  decoherence-free subspaces and quantum error
                  correction codes. We then give means for empirically
                  determining an appropriate set of dynamical
                  decoupling operations for a given experiment. Using
                  these techniques, we then propose a comprehensive
                  encoding solution to many of the problems of quantum
                  computing proposals which use exchange-type
                  interactions. This uses a decoherence-free subspace
                  and an efficient set of dynamical decoupling
                  operations. It also addresses the problem of
                  controllability in solid-state quantum dot devices.}

                  leading to electron spin resonance (ESR). We show

                  including contributions to decoherence and energy
                  shifts due to the tunnel coupling. We give a
                  detailed analysis of sequential and cotunneling
                  currents, for linearly and circularly oscillating
                  ESR fields, applied in cw and pulsed modes. We show

                  bound on the decoherence time T2 of the spin- state
                  on the dot. Similarly, the spin decoherence can be
                  accessed also in the cotunneling regime via
                  ESR-induced spin flips. We show that the conductance

                  saturates at the universal conductance ratio of 0.71

                  setup which generates spin-dependent tunneling and
                  acts as a current pump (at zero bias) and as a spin
                  inverter which inverts the spin polarization of the
                  current, even in a homogeneous magnetic field. We
                  show that Rabi oscillations of the dot spin induce
                  coherent oscillations in the time-dependent
                  current. These oscillations are observable in the

                  distributed in these and other applications by
                  entangling the quantum memory with the communication
                  channel. Here we report quantum entanglement between

                  single- and multiqubit operations critical to
                  quantum computation. The computational qubits are
                  eigenstates of large-area, current-biased Josephson
                  junctions, manipulated and measured using strobed
                  external circuitry. Two or more of these phase
                  qubits are capacitively coupled to a
                  high-quality-factor piezoelectric
                  nanoelectromechanical disk resonator, which forms
                  the backbone of our architecture, and which enables
                  coherent coupling of the qubits. The integrated
                  system is analogous to one or more few-level atoms
                  (the Josephson junction qubits) in an
                  electromagnetic cavity (the nanomechanical
                  resonator). However, unlike existing approaches
                  using atoms in electromagnetic cavities, here we can
                  individually tune the level spacing of the "atoms"
                  and control their "electromagnetic" interaction
                  strength. We show theoretically that quantum states
                  prepared in a Josephson junction can be passed to
                  the nanomechanical resonator and stored there, and
                  then can be passed back to the original junction or
                  transferred to another with high fidelity. The
                  resonator can also be used to produce maximally
                  entangled Bell states between a pair of Josephson
                  junctions. Many such junction-resonator complexes
                  can be assembled in a hub-and-spoke layout,

Qubit-qubit interaction in quantum computers

    Julio Gea-Banacloche
    University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas 72701

Received 11 August 1997

Limitations to the performance of a quantum computer arising from direct interaction between qubits are considered, and the basic scaling laws (with the computation time and the number of qubits) are established for the specific example of the quantum Fourier transform algorithm. These results should be relevant for several of the currently proposed quantum computer systems, where the dominant interaction is of the magnetic dipole-dipole type, in the limit of many qubits and long computation times.

We provide fast algorithms for simulating many-body Fermi systems on a universal quantum computer. Both first and second quantized descriptions are considered, and the relative computational complexities are determined in each case. In order to accommodate fermions using a first quantized Hamiltonian, an efficient quantum algorithm for antisymmetrization is given. Finally, a simulation of the Hubbard model is discussed in detail.

We propose a scheme to utilize photons for ideal quantum transmission between atoms located at spatially separated nodes of a quantum network. The transmission protocol employs special laser pulses that excite an atom inside an optical cavity at the sending node so that its state is mapped into a time-symmetric photon wave packet that will enter a cavity at the receiving node and be absorbed by an atom there with unit probability. Implementation of our scheme would enable reliable transfer or sharing of entanglement among spatially distant atoms.

Quantum-nondemolition measurement of the vibrational energy of a trapped ion

    F. E. Harrison, A. S. Parkins, M. J. Collett, and D. F. Walls
    Department of Physics, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand

A quantum-nondemolition (QND) measurement of the vibrational energy of a trapped ion may be made by placing it at a node of a cavity optical standing wave. In certain parameter regimes there is a backaction evading coupling between the ion's vibrational energy eigenstates and the coherent states of the cavity field. This facilitates a QND measurement of the ion trap state via a homodyne measurement on the cavity output field. This scheme has the advantage that the required measurements minimally disturb the ion.

Minimum energy state of the one-dimensional Coulomb chain

    Daniel H. E. Dubin
    Department of Physics, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0319

Received 17 October 1996

One-dimensional chains of laser-cooled ions have recently been confined in the fields of electromagnetic traps. This paper considers the minimum energy states of this one-dimensional (1D) form of condensed matter. Molecular dynamics simulations of the minimum energy states are compared to a density functional theory of the inhomogeneous crystal. Unlike 2D and 3D inhomogeneous Coulombic systems, where mean-field theory works well in describing the overall density variation on scales large compared to an interparticle spacing, we show that correlations are essential in determining the density of the 1D Coulomb chain. On the other hand, the long-range interactions that contribute to the mean field must also be kept.

An error prevention procedure based on two-particle encoding is proposed for protecting an arbitrary unknown quantum state from dissipation, such as phase damping and amplitude damping. The schemes, which exhibits manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect, is effective whether quantum bits are decohered independently or cooperatively. We derive the working condition of the scheme, and argue that this procedure has feasible practical implementation.

We identify a 2-bit quantum gate that is sufficient to build any quantum logic network. The existence of such a 2-bit universal gate considerably simplifies the search for physical realizations of quantum computational networks. We propose an explicit construction of this gate, which is based on cavity QED techniques and may be realizable with current technology.

Received 3 August 1998

We consider a quantum-gate mechanism based on electron spins in
coupled semiconductor quantum dots. Such gates provide a general
source of spin entanglement and can be used for quantum computers. We
determine the exchange coupling J in the effective Heisenberg model as
a function of magnetic (B) and electric fields, and of the interdot
distance a within the Heitler-London approximation of molecular
physics. This result is refined by using sp hybridization, and by the
Hund-Mulliken molecular-orbit approach, which leads to an extended
Hubbard description for the two-dot system that shows a remarkable
dependence on B and a due to the long-range Coulomb interaction. We
find that the exchange J changes sign at a finite field (leading to a
pronounced jump in the magnetization) and then decays
exponentially. The magnetization and the spin susceptibilities of the
coupled dots are calculated. We show that the dephasing due to nuclear
spins in GaAs can be strongly suppressed by dynamical nuclear-spin
polarization and/or by magnetic fields.

Decoherence and fidelity in ion traps with fluctuating trap parameters

    S. Schneider and G. J. Milburn
    Centre for Laser Science, Department of Physics, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, QLD 4072, Australia

Received 15 October 1998

We consider two different kinds of fluctuations in an ion trap potential: external fluctuating electrical fields, which cause statistical movement ("wobbling") of the ion relative to the center of the trap, and fluctuations of the spring constant, which are due to fluctuations of the ac component of the potential applied in the Paul trap for ions. We write down master equations for both cases and, averaging out the noise, obtain expressions for the heating of the ion. We compare our results to previous results for far-off resonance optical traps and heating in ion traps. The effect of fluctuating external electrical fields for a quantum gate operation (controlled-NOT) is determined and the fidelity for that operation derived.

Received 8 March 1999

A quantum computer is proposed in which information is stored in the two lowest electronic states of doped quantum dots (QD's). Many QD's are located in a microcavity. A pair of gates controls the energy levels in each QD. A controlled-NOT (C-NOT) operation involving any pair of QD's can be effected by a sequence of gate-voltage pulses which tune the QD energy levels into resonance with frequencies of the cavity or a laser. The duration of a C-NOT operation is estimated to be much shorter than the time for an electron to decohere by emitting an acoustic phonon.

Scalable solid-state quantum computer based on quantum dot pillar structures

Received 11 October 1999

We investigate an optically driven quantum computer based on electric dipole transitions within coupled single-electron quantum dots. Our quantum register consists of a free-standing n-type pillar containing a series of pairwise coupled asymmetric quantum dots, each with a slightly different energy structure, and with grounding leads at the top and bottom of the pillar. Asymmetric quantum wells confine electrons along the pillar axis, and a negatively biased gate wrapped around the center of the pillar allows for electrostatic confinement in the radial direction. We self-consistently solve coupled Schrödinger and Poisson equations and develop a design for a three-qubit quantum register. Our results indicate that a single gate electrode can be used to localize a single electron in each of the quantum dots. Adjacent dots are strongly coupled by electric dipole-dipole interactions arising from the dot asymmetry, thus enabling rapid computation rates. The dots are tailored to minimize dephasing due to spontaneous emission and phonon scattering and to maximize the number of computation cycles. The design is scalable to a large number of qubits.

We apply the full power of modern electronic band-structure engineering and epitaxial heterostructures to design a transistor that can sense and control a single-donor electron spin. Spin-resonance transistors may form the technological basis for quantum information processing. One- and two-qubit operations are performed by applying a gate bias. The bias electric field pulls the electron wave function away from the dopant ion into layers of different alloy composition. Owing to the variation of the g factor (Si:g=1.998,Ge:g=1.563), this displacement changes the spin Zeeman energy, allowing single-qubit operations. By displacing the electron even further, the overlap with neighboring qubits is affected, which allows two-qubit operations. Certain silicon-germanium alloys allow a qubit spacing as large as 200 nm, which is well within the capabilities of current lithographic techniques. We discuss manufacturing limitations and issues regarding scaling up to a large size computer.

(Received 4 January 2002; published 23 April 2002)

Based on an idea that spatial separation of charge states can enhance quantum coherence, we propose a scheme for a quantum computation with the quantum bit (qubit) constructed from two coupled quantum dots. Quantum information is stored in the electron-hole pair state with the electron and hole located in different dots, which enables the qubit state to be very long-lived. Universal quantum gates involving any pair of qubits are realized by coupling the quantum dots through the cavity photon which is a hopeful candidate for the transfer of long-range information. The operation analysis is carried out by estimating the gate time versus the decoherence time.

We show two effects as a result of considering the second-order correction to the spectrum of a nanomechanical resonator electrostatically coupled to a Cooper-pair box. The spectrum of the Cooper-pair box is modified in a way which depends on the Fock state of the resonator. Similarly, the frequency of the resonator becomes dependent upon the state of the Cooper-pair box. We consider whether these frequency shifts could be utilized to prepare the nanomechanical resonator in a Fock state, to perform a quantum non-demolition measurement of the resonator Fock state, and to distinguish the phase states of the Cooper-pair box.

We present a general method for studying coupled qubits driven by adiabatically changing external parameters. Extended calculations are provided for a two-bit Hamiltonian whose eigenstates can be used as logical states for a quantum CNOT gate. From a numerical analysis of the stationary Schrödinger equation we find a set of parameters suitable for representing CNOT, while from a time-dependent study the conditions for adiabatic evolution are determined. Specializing to a concrete physical system involving superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID's), we determine reasonable parameters for experimental purposes. The dissipation for SQUID's is discussed by fitting experimental data. The low dissipation obtained supports the idea that adiabatic operations could be performed on a time scale shorter than the decoherence time.

(Received 25 April 2003; published 9 January 2004)

This paper discusses ways to implement two-qubit gate operations for quantum computing with cold trapped ions within one step. The proposed scheme is widely robust against parameter fluctuations and its simplicity might help to increase the number of qubits in present experiments. The basic idea is to use the quantum Zeno effect originating from continuous measurements on a common vibrational mode to realize gate operations with very high fidelities. The gate success rate can, in principle, be arbitrarily high but operation times comparable to other schemes can only be obtained by accepting success rates below 80%.

                  never be found to decay!. Since recording the track
                  of an unstable particle (which can be distinguished
                  from its decay products) approximately realizes such
                  continuous observations, the above conclusion seems
                  to pose a paradox which we call Zenoâ€™s paradox in
                  quantum theory. The relation of this result to that
                  of some previous works and its implications and
                  possible resolutions are briefly discussed. The
                  mathematical transcription of the aboveâ€mentioned
                  conclusion is a structure theorem concerning
                  semigroups. Although special cases of this theorem
                  are known, the general formulation and the proof
                  given here are believed to be new. We also note that
                  the known â€™â€™noâ€goâ€™â€™ theorem concerning the semigroup
                  law for the reduced evolution of any physical system
                  (including decaying systems) is subsumed under our
                  theorem as a direct corollary.}

Control of Trapped-Ion Quantum States with Optical Pulses

(Received 1 August 2003; published 19 March 2004)

We present new results on the quantum control of systems with infinitely large Hilbert spaces. A control-theoretic analysis of the control of trapped-ion quantum states via optical pulses is performed. We demonstrate how resonant bichromatic fields can be applied in two contrasting ways—one that makes the system completely uncontrollable and the other that makes the system controllable. In some interesting cases, the Hilbert space of the qubit-harmonic oscillator can be made finite, and the Schrödinger equation controllable via bichromatic resonant pulses. Extending this analysis to the quantum states of two ions, a new scheme for producing entangled qubits is discovered.

We present a generic model of coupling quantum-optical and solid-state qubits, and the corresponding transfer protocols. The example discussed is a trapped ion coupled to a charge qubit (e.g., Cooper pair box). To enhance the coupling and to achieve compatibility between the different experimental setups we introduce a superconducting cavity as the connecting element.

Multiqubit controlled unitary gate by adiabatic passage with an optical cavity

Hayato Goto and Kouichi Ichimura

Advanced Materials and Devices Laboratory, Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, 1 Komukai Toshiba-cho, Saiwai-ku, Kawasaki 212-8582, Japan

(Received 31 October 2003; revised 3 February 2004; published 9 July 2004)

A new implementation of quantum gates by adiabatic passage with an optical cavity is proposed. This implementation allows one to perform not only elementary gates, such as one-qubit gates and a controlled-NOT gate, but also multiqubit controlled unitary gates. Some quantum gates are numerically simulated. From the simulation results, it is concluded that this implementation of the three-qubit controlled gates is more efficient than decomposing into the elementary gates.

Decoherence in a system of strongly coupled quantum oscillators. I. Symmetric network

Departamento de Física, CCET, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Via Washington Luiz Km 235, São Carlos, 13565-905, SP, Brazil

(Received 6 January 2004; published 30 August 2004)

In this work we analyze the coherence dynamics and estimate decoherence times of quantum states in a network composed of N coupled dissipative quantum oscillators. We assume a symmetric network where all oscillators are coupled to each other with the same coupling strength. Master equations are derived for regimes of both weak and strong coupling between the oscillators. The strong coupling regime is characterized by the coupling strength between the oscillators or by the number of oscillators in the network. The decoherence times of particular states of the network are computed and the results are clarified by analyzing the processes of state swap and recurrence of reduced states of the network together with the linear entropies of the joint and reduced systems.

Cooperative effects in Josephson junctions in a cavity in the strong coupling regime

Marco Frasca

Via Erasmo Gattamelata, 3, 00176 Roma, Italy

(Received 6 November 2004; revised 24 January 2005; published 31 May 2005)

We analyze the behavior of systems of two and three qubits made by Josephson junctions, treated in the two level approximation, driven by a radiation mode in a cavity. The regime we consider is a strong coupling one recently experimentally reached for a single junction. Rabi oscillations are obtained with the frequency proportional to integer order Bessel functions in the limit of a large photon number, similarly to the case of the single qubit. A selection rule is derived for the appearance of Rabi oscillations. A quantum amplifier built with a large number of Josephson junctions in a cavity in the strong coupling regime is also described.

Decoherence of a two-state atom driven by coherent light

Hyunchul Nha and H. J. Carmichael

Department of Physics, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand

(Received 14 July 2004; published 10 January 2005)

Recent studies of the decoherence induced by the quantum nature of the laser field driving a two-state atom [J. Gea-Banacloche, Phys. Rev. A 65, 022308 (2002); S. J. van Enk and H. J. Kimble, Quantum Inf. Comput. 2, 1 (2002)] have been questioned by Itano [W. M. Itano, Phys. Rev. A 68, 046301 (2003)] and the proposal made that all decoherence is due to spontaneous emission. We analyze the problem within the formalism of cascaded open quantum systems. Our conclusions agree with the Itano proposal. We show that the decoherence, nevertheless, may be divided into two parts—that due to forwards scattering and to scattering out of the laser mode. Previous authors attribute the former to the quantum nature of the laser field.

We study quantum feedback cooling of atomic motion in an optical cavity. We design a feedback algorithm that can cool the atom to the ground state of the optical potential with high efficiency despite the nonlinear nature of this problem. An important ingredient is a simplified state-estimation algorithm, necessary for a real-time implementation of the feedback loop. We also describe the critical role of parity dynamics in the cooling process and present a simple theory that predicts the achievable steady-state atomic energies.

Transition to classical chaos in a coupled quantum system through continuous measurement

Continuous observation of a quantum system yields a measurement record that faithfully reproduces the classically predicted trajectory provided that the measurement is sufficiently strong to localize the state in phase space but weak enough that quantum backaction noise is negligible. We investigate the conditions under which classical dynamics emerges, via a continuous position measurement, for a particle moving in a harmonic well with its position coupled to internal spin. As a consequence of this coupling, we find that classical dynamics emerges only when the position and spin actions are both large compared to [h-bar]. These conditions are quantified by placing bounds on the size of the covariance matrix which describes the delocalized quantum coherence over extended regions of phase space. From this result, it follows that a mixed quantum-classical regime (where one subsystem can be treated classically and the other not) does not exist for a continuously observed spin-(1/2) particle. When the conditions for classicality are satisfied (in the large-spin limit), the quantum trajectories reproduce both the classical periodic orbits as well as the classically chaotic phase space regions. As a quantitative test of this convergence, we compute the largest Lyapunov exponent directly from the measured quantum trajectories and show that it agrees with the classical value.

Feedback cooling of a nanomechanical resonator

Cooled, low-loss nanomechanical resonators offer the prospect of directly observing the quantum dynamics of mesoscopic systems. However, the present state of the art requires cooling down to the milliKelvin regime in order to observe quantum effects. Here we present an active feedback strategy based on continuous observation of the resonator position for the purpose of obtaining these low temperatures. In addition, we apply this to an experimentally realizable configuration, where the position monitoring is carried out by a single-electron transistor. Our estimates indicate that with current technology this technique is likely to bring the required low temperatures within reach.

We introduce and discuss the problem of quantum feedback control in the context of established formulations of classical control theory, examining conceptual analogies and essential differences. We describe the application of state-observer-based control laws, familiar in classical control theory, to quantum systems and apply our methods to the particular case of switching the state of a particle in a double-well potential.

delta-function-kicked rotor: Momentum diffusion and the quantum-classical boundary

(Received 21 May 2001; published 20 February 2002)

We investigate the quantum-classical transition in the delta-function-kicked rotor and the attainment of the classical limit in terms of measurement-induced state localization. It is possible to study the transition by fixing the environmentally induced disturbance at a sufficiently small value, and examining the dynamics as the system is made more macroscopic. When the system action is relatively small, the dynamics is quantum mechanical and when the system action is sufficiently large there is a transition to classical behavior. The dynamics of the rotor in the region of transition, characterized by the late-time momentum diffusion coefficient, can be strikingly different from both the purely quantum and classical results. Remarkably, the early-time diffusive behavior of the quantum system, even when different from its classical counterpart, is stabilized by the continuous measurement process. This shows that such measurements can succeed in extracting essentially quantum effects. The transition regime studied in this paper is accessible in ongoing experiments.

Robust control in the quantum domain

Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure
Journal-ref: Proceedings of the 39th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, p949 (2000)

    Recent progress in quantum physics has made it possible to perform experiments in which individual quantum systems are monitored and manipulated in real time. The advent of such new technical capabilities provides strong motivation for the development of theoretical and experimental methodologies for quantum feedback control. The availability of such methods would enable radically new approaches to experimental physics in the quantum realm. Likewise, the investigation of quantum feedback control will introduce crucial new considerations to control theory, such as the uniquely quantum phenomena of entanglement and measurement back-action. The extension of established analysis techniques from control theory into the quantum domain may also provide new insight into the dynamics of complex quantum systems. We anticipate that the successful formulation of an input-output approach to the analysis and reduction of large quantum systems could have very general applications in non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and in the nascent field of quantum information theory.

    The vast majority of the literature dealing with quantum dynamics is concerned with linear evolution of the wave function or the density matrix. A complete dynamical description requires a full understanding of the evolution of measured quantum systems, necessary to explain actual experimental results. The dynamics of such systems is intrinsically nonlinear even at the level of distribution functions, both classically as well as quantum mechanically. Aside from being physically more complete, this treatment reveals the existence of dynamical regimes, such as chaos, that have no counterpart in the linear case. Here, we present a short introductory review of some of these aspects, with a few illustrative results and examples.

Spectrum of qubit oscillations from Bloch equations
Authors: Rusko Ruskov, Alexander N. Korotkov

Journal-ref: Phys. Rev. B 67, 075303 (2003)

    We have developed a formalism suitable for calculation of the output spectrum of a detector continuously measuring quantum coherent oscillations in a solid-state qubit, starting from microscopic Bloch equations. The results coincide with that obtained using Bayesian and master equation approaches. The previous results are generalized to the cases of arbitrary detector response and finite detector temperature. }

                  ground state and a weak noise sensitivity are
                  consequences of the tetrahedral symmetry, while
                  enhanced quantum fluctuations derive from the
                  special magnetic frustration. We determine the
                  spectral properties of the tetrahedral structure
                  within a semiclassical analysis and confirm the
                  results numerically. We show how proper tuning of
                  the charge-frustration selects a doubly degenerate
                  ground state and discuss the qubit's manipulation
                  through capacitive and inductive coupling to

                  interaction with an independent bath. We first
                  consider the scheme in the case of a trivial
                  single-qubit code, which provides useful insights
                  into the workings of continuous error correction and

                  decoherence. We then study the model of a bit-flip

                  general codes and argue that the performance of

                  to be measured in terms of the change in a strong signal
                  displayed by an abundant a nuclear species. The a

                  field in the frame of reference rotating at its Larmor
                  frequency. The b nuclear resonance is obtained

                  that capitalize on the fact that many physical error models
                  lead to a significant asymmetry between the probabilities
                  for bit- and phase-flip errors. An example for a channel
                  that exhibits such asymmetry is the combined amplitude
                  damping and dephasing channel, where the probabilities of
                  bit and phase flips can be related to relaxation and
                  dephasing time, respectively. We study asymmetric quantum
                  codes that are obtained from the
                  Calderbank–Shor–Steane (CSS) construction. For such
                  codes, we derive upper bounds on the code parameters using
                  linear programming. A central result of this paper is the
                  explicit construction of some new families of asymmetric
                  quantum stabilizer codes from pairs of nested classical
                  codes. For instance, we derive asymmetric codes using a

                  finite geometry low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We
                  show that the asymmetric quantum codes offer two advantages,
                  namely to allow a higher rate without sacrificing
                  performance when compared with symmetric codes and vice
                  versa to allow a higher performance when compared with
                  symmetric codes of comparable rates. Our approach is based
                  on a CSS construction that combines BCH and finite geometry

                  model. The effects of the decoupling pulses are then
                  incorporated. A wide class of decoupling pulses can
                  be described equally within this approach. We have
                  performed a comprehensive investigation on the

                  including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and the

                  computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate
                  any physical computational device with a cost in computation
                  time of at most a polynomial factor: It is not clear whether
                  this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into
                  consideration. Several researchers, starting with David
                  Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical
                  computers and have investigated their computational
                  properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for
                  finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a
                  quantum computer that take a number of steps which is
                  polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of
                  the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally
                  considered hard on a classical computer and have been used
                  as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give

                  Couriers or other secure means are not needed to
                  transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered
                  using an encryption key publicly revealed by the
                  intented recipient. Only he can decipher the
                  message, since only he knows the corresponding
                  decryption key. (2) A message can be â€œsignedâ€ using
                  a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify
                  this signature using the corresponding publicly
                  revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be
                  forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity
                  of his signature. This has obvious applications in
                  â€œelectronic mailâ€ and â€œelectronic funds transferâ€
                  systems. A message is encrypted by representing it
                  as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified
                  power e, and then taking the remainder when the
                  result is divided by the publicly specified product,
                  n, of two large secret primer numbers p and
                  q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret,

                  1)). The security of the system rests in part on the
                  difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.}

                  coherent states against noise and other unwanted
                  interactions in quantum computation and communication. We
                  develop a general theory of quantum error correction based
                  on encoding states into larger Hilbert spaces subject to
                  known interactions. We obtain necessary and sufficient
                  conditions for the perfect recovery of an encoded state
                  after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions
                  depend only on the behavior of the logical states. We use
                  them to give a recovery-operator-independent definition of
                  error-correcting codes. We relate this definition to four
                  others: the existence of a left inverse of the interaction,
                  an explicit representation of the error syndrome using
                  tensor products, perfect recovery of the completely
                  entangled state, and an information theoretic identity. Two
                  notions of fidelity and error for imperfect recovery are
                  introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled
                  states. The latter is more appropriate when using codes in a
                  quantum memory or in applications of quantum teleportation
                  to communication. We show that the error for entangled
                  states is bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A
                  formal definition of independent interactions for qubits is
                  given. This leads to lower bounds on the number of qubits
                  required to correct e errors and a formal proof that the
                  classical bounds on the probability of error of
                  e-error-correcting codes applies to e-error-correcting
                  quantum codes, provided that the interaction is dominated by
                  an identity component.}

                  quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) provide two
                  ways of protecting quantum states from interaction
                  with the environment. In an EPP, perfectly entangled
                  pure states are extracted, with some yield D, from a
                  mixed state M shared by two parties; with a QECC, an
                  arbitrary quantum state |¾Ó can be transmitted at
                  some rate Q through a noisy channel Ç without
                  degradation. We prove that an EPP involving one-way
                  classical communication and acting on mixed state
                  M^(Ç) (obtained by sharing halves of
                  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs through a channel Ç)
                  yields a QECC on Ç with rate Q=D, and vice versa. We
                  compare the amount of entanglement E(M) required to
                  prepare a mixed state M by local actions with the
                  amounts D1(M) and D2(M) that can be locally
                  distilled from it by EPPs using one- and two-way
                  classical communication, respectively, and give an
                  exact expression for E(M) when M is Bell
                  diagonal. While EPPs require classical
                  communication, QECCs do not, and we prove Q is not
                  increased by adding one-way classical
                  communication. However, both D and Q can be
                  increased by adding two-way communication. We show
                  that certain noisy quantum channels, for example a
                  50\% depolarizing channel, can be used for reliable
                  transmission of quantum states if two-way
                  communication is available, but cannot be used if
                  only one-way communication is available. We exhibit
                  a family of codes based on universal hashing able to
                  achieve an asymptotic Q (or D) of 1-S for simple
                  noise models, where S is the error entropy. We also
                  obtain a specific, simple 5-bit
                  single-error-correcting quantum block code. We prove
                  that iff a QECC results in high fidelity for the
                  case of no error then the QECC can be recast into a
                  form where the encoder is the matrix inverse of the

                  networks are studied by a combination of numerical
                  and approximate analytical treatments. The
                  probability of failure of the recovery operation is
                  calculated for a variety of Calderbank-Shor-Steane
                  codes, including large block codes and concatenated
                  codes. Recent insights into the syndrome extraction
                  process, which render the whole process more
                  efficient and more noise tolerant, are
                  incorporated. The average number of recoveries that
                  can be completed without failure is thus estimated
                  as a function of various parameters. The main
                  parameters are the gate ³ and memory µ failure
                  rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size,
                  and the time tm required for measurements and
                  classical processing. The achievable computation
                  size is given as a surface in parameter space. This
                  indicates the noise threshold as well as other
                  information. It is found that concatenated codes
                  based on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher
                  thresholds than those based on the [[7,1,3]] Hamming
                  code under most conditions. The threshold gate noise
                  0 is a function of µ/³ and tm; example values are
                  {µ/³,tm,³0}={1,1,10-3}, {0.01,1,3×10-3},
                  {1,100,10-4}, {0.01,100,2×10-3}, assuming zero cost
                  for information transport. This represents an order
                  of magnitude increase in tolerated memory noise,
                  compared with previous calculations, which is made
                  possible by recent insights into the fault-tolerant
                  QEC process.}

                  according to the fundamental laws of physicsâ€”offers
                  a means to solve efficiently a small but significant
                  set of classically intractable problems. Quantum
                  computers are based on the controlled manipulation
                  of entangled quantum states, which are extremely
                  sensitive to noise and imprecision; active
                  correction of errors must therefore be implemented
                  without causing loss of coherence. Quantum
                  error-correction theory2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 has
                  made great progress in this regard, by predicting
                  error-correcting 'codeword' quantum states. But the
                  coding is inefficient and requires many quantum
                  bits10, 11, 12, which results in physically unwieldy
                  fault-tolerant quantum circuits10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
                  15, 16, 17, 18. Here I report a general technique
                  for circumventing the trade-off between the achieved
                  noise tolerance and the scale-up in computer size
                  that is required to realize the error correction. I
                  adapt the recovery operation (the process by which
                  noise is suppressed through error detection and
                  correction) to simultaneously correct errors and
                  perform a useful measurement that drives the
                  computation. The result is that a quantum computer
                  need be only an order of magnitude larger than the
                  logic device contained within it. For example, the
                  physical scale-up factor10,11 required to factorize
                  a thousand-digit number is reduced from 1,500 to 22,
                  while preserving the original tolerated gate error
                  rate (10 -5) and memory noise per bit (10-7). The
                  difficulty of realizing a useful quantum computer is
                  therefore significantly reduced.}

                  theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some
                  close ties to and some striking differences from the
                  theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many
                  quantum codes can be described in terms of the
                  stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a
                  finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward
                  characterization of the error-correcting properties
                  of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum
                  codes also illustrates the relationships to
                  classical coding theory, particularly classical
                  codes over GF(4), the finite field with four
                  elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves
                  correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a
                  theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation,
                  instructing us how to perform quantum gates on
                  qubits which are encoded in a quantum
                  error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states
                  that it is possible to create a quantum computer to
                  perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided
                  the error rate per physical gate or time step is

                  quantum computing is to stabilize the computation
                  against unwanted interactions with the environment
                  and imperfections in the applied
                  operations. Existing proposals for quantum memories
                  and quantum channels require gates with
                  asymptotically zero error to store or transmit an
                  input quantum state for arbitrarily long times or
                  distances with fixed error. In this report a method
                  is given which has the property that to store or
                  transmit a qubit with maximum error $\epsilon$
                  requires gates with error at most $c\epsilon$ and
                  storage or channel elements with error at most
                  $\epsilon$, independent of how long we wish to store
                  the state or how far we wish to transmit it. The
                  method relies on using concatenated quantum codes
                  with hierarchically implemented recovery
                  operations. The overhead of the method is polynomial
                  in the time of storage or the distance of the
                  transmission. Rigorous and heuristic lower bounds
                  for the constant $c$ are given. }

                  propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse
                  classical codes. Quantum codes pose two new
                  challenges however. Firstly, their Tanner graph
                  unavoidably contain small loops which typically
                  undermines the performance of belief
                  propagation. Secondly, sparse quantum codes are by
                  definition highly degenerate. The standard belief
                  propagation algorithm does not exploit this feature,
                  but rather it is impaired by it. We propose
                  heuristic methods to improve belief propagation
                  decoding, specifically targeted at these two

                  the last two decades centered on the manipulation of
                  individual quanta of information, known as quantum
                  bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum
                  cryptography, and quantum teleportation are among
                  the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from
                  this new field. It was realized later on that using
                  continuous-variable quantum information carriers,
                  instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful
                  alternative approach to quantum information
                  processing. This review focuses on
                  continuous-variable quantum information processes
                  that rely on any combination of Gaussian states,
                  Gaussian operations, and Gaussian
                  measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to
                  the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits,
                  since on the theoretical side, simple analytical
                  tools are available and, on the experimental side,
                  optical components effecting Gaussian processes are
                  readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian
                  quantum information processing opens the way to a
                  wide variety of tasks and applications, including
                  quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum
                  computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum
                  state and channel discrimination. This review
                  reports on the state of the art in this field,
                  ranging from the basic theoretical tools and

                  codes for a bosonic mode which are advantageous for
                  applications in quantum memories, communication, and
                  scalable computation.  These â€˜binomial
                  quantum codesâ€™ are formed from a finite
                  superposition of Fock states weighted with binomial
                  coefficients. The binomial codes can exactly correct
                  errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree
                  in bosonic creation and annihilation operators,
                  including amplitude damping and displacement noise
                  as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For
                  realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the
                  codes can perform approximate quantum error
                  correction to any given order in the timestep
                  between error detection measurements. We present an
                  explicit approximate quantum error recovery
                  operation based on projective measurements and
                  unitary operations. The binomial codes are tailored
                  for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means of
                  measurements of the generalized number parity. We
                  discuss optimization of the binomial codes and
                  demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure,
                  codes with even lower unrecoverable error rates can
                  be achieved. The binomial codes are related to
                  existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the
                  advantage of requiring only a single bosonic mode to
                  correct amplitude damping as well as the ability to
                  correct other errors. Our codes are similar in
                  spirit to â€˜cat codesâ€™ based on
                  superpositions of the coherent states, but offer
                  several advantages such as smaller mean boson
                  number, exact rather than approximate orthonormality
                  of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation
                  for repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The
                  binomial quantum codes are realizable with current
                  superconducting circuit technology and they should
                  prove useful in other quantum technologies,
                  including bosonic quantum memories, photonic quantum
                  communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and

In order to dynamically decouple a spin or quantum bit from a dephasing environment by non-instantaneous pulses, we introduce an optimized sequence of N control À pulses that are realistic in the sense that they have a finite duration and a finite amplitude. We show that optimized dynamical decoupling is still applicable and that higher-order decoupling can be reached if shaped pulses are implemented.

                  quantum simulation, at the cost of needing to
                  protect fragile quantum states from error. Quantum
                  error correction provides this protection by
                  distributing a logical state among many physical
                  quantum bits (qubits) by means of quantum
                  entanglement. Superconductivity is a useful
                  phenomenon in this regard, because it allows the
                  construction of large quantum circuits and is
                  compatible with microfabrication. For
                  superconducting qubits, the surface code approach to
                  quantum computing is a natural choice for error
                  correction, because it uses only nearest-neighbour
                  coupling and rapidly cycled entangling gates. The
                  gate fidelity requirements are modest: the per-step
                  fidelity threshold is only about 99 per cent. Here
                  we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a
                  superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an
                  average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92 per cent
                  and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.4 per
                  cent. This places Josephson quantum computing at the
                  fault-tolerance threshold for surface code error
                  correction. Our quantum processor is a first step
                  towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged
                  in a linear array with nearest-neighbour
                  coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a
                  five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state 
                  using the complete circuit and full set of
                  gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson
                  quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology,

                  in D spatial dimensions and has d = n1-Îµ-1/D, nearly
                  saturating a bound due to Bravyi and Terhal.  Our
                  construction is based on a new general method for
                  turning quantum circuits into sparse quantum
                  subsystem codes. Using this prescription, we can map
                  an arbitrary stabilizer code into a new subsystem
                  code with the same distance and number of encoded
                  qubits but where all the generators have constant
                  weight, at the cost of adding some ancilla
                  qubits. With an additional overhead of ancilla
                  qubits, the new code can also be made spatially
                  local.  }

                  LDPC codes have been actively studied recently due
                  to their simple syndrome readout circuits and
                  potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum
                  computing. However, all families of quantum LDPC
                  codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance
                  scaling limited by the square-root of the code
                  length. This is in a sharp contrast with the
                  classical case where good families of LDPC codes are
                  known that combine constant encoding rate and linear
                  distance. Here we propose the first family of good
                  quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new
                  codes have a constant encoding rate, linear
                  distance, and stabilizers acting on at most
                  $\sqrt{n}$ qubits, where $n$ is the code length. For
                  comparison, all previously known families of good
                  quantum codes have stabilizers of linear weight. Our
                  proof combines two techniques: randomized
                  constructions of good quantum codes and the
                  homological product operation from algebraic
                  topology. We conjecture that similar methods can
                  produce good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight
                  $n^a$ for any $a>0$. Finally, we apply the
                  homological product to construct new small codes

                  is obtained by implementing computations with
                  generic stabilizer code teleportation steps that
                  combine the necessary operations with error
                  correction. An interesting consequence of the
                  technique is that the only errors that affect the
                  maximum tolerable error rate are storage and Bell
                  measurement errors. If storage errors are
                  negligible, then any detected Bell measurement error
                  below 1/2 is permissible. Another consequence of the
                  technique is that the maximum tolerable depolarizing
                  error rate is dominated by how well one can prepare
                  the required encoded states. For example, if storage
                  and Bell measurement errors are relatively small,
                  then independent depolarizing errors with error rate
                  close to 0.1 per qubit are tolerable in the prepared
                  states. The implementation overhead is dominated by
                  the efficiency with which the required encoded
                  states can be prepared. At present, this efficiency
                  is very low, particularly for error rates close to

  abstract =	 {We study properties of stabilizer codes that permit
                  a local description on a regular D -dimensional
                  lattice. Specifically, we assume that the stabilizer
                  group of a code (the gauge group for subsystem
                  codes) can be generated by local Pauli operators
                  such that the support of any generator is bounded by
                  a hypercube of size O (1). Our first result concerns
                  the optimal scaling of the distance d with the
                  linear size of the lattice L . We prove an upper
                  bound d = O ( L D -1 ) which is tight for D =1,
                  2. This bound applies to both subspace and subsystem
                  stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the
                  suitability of stabilizer codes for building a
                  self-correcting quantum memory. Any stabilizer code
                  with geometrically local generators can be naturally
                  transformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states
                  that violate the stabilizer condition. A degenerate
                  ground state of this Hamiltonian corresponds to the
                  logical subspace of the code. We prove that for D
                  =1, 2, different logical states can be mapped into
                  each other by a sequence of single-qubit Pauli
                  errors such that the energy of all intermediate
                  states is upper bounded by a constant independent of
                  the lattice size L . The same result holds if there
                  are unused logical qubits that are treated as 'gauge
                  qubits'. It demonstrates that a self-correcting
                  quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer
                  codes in dimensions D =1, 2. This result is in sharp
                  contrast with the existence of a classical
                  self-correcting memory in the form of a
                  two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet. Our results leave
                  open the possibility for a self-correcting quantum
                  memory based on 2D subsystem codes or on 3D subspace
                  or subsystem codes.}

                  question, we construct purification protocols that

                  output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols
                  allow one to increase the polarization only along

                  (about 65 percent), the purification asymptotically

                  gatesâ€”can be simulated efficiently on a classical
                  computer. This paper improves that theorem in
                  several directions. First, by removing the need for
                  Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation
                  algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2
                  increase in the number of bits needed to represent a
                  state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in
                  a freely available program called CHP
                  (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of
                  qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of

                  stabilizer circuit into a "canonical form" that

                  a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and
                  circuits acting on general tensor-product initial

                  two-level quantum systems (qubits) by rectifying
                  errors with operations conditioned on the
                  measurement outcomes. Error-correction protocols
                  have been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance

                  this technique7 prevent its application to quantum
                  information processing. Here we experimentally
                  demonstrate quantum error correction using three
                  beryllium atomic-ion qubits confined to a linear,
                  multi-zone trap. An encoded one-qubit state is
                  protected against spin-flip errors by means of a
                  three-qubit quantum error-correcting code. A primary
                  ion qubit is prepared in an initial state, which is
                  then encoded into an entangled state of three
                  physical qubits (the primary and two ancilla
                  qubits). Errors are induced simultaneously in all
                  qubits at various rates. The encoded state is
                  decoded back to the primary ion one-qubit state,
                  making error information available on the ancilla
                  ions, which are separated from the primary ion and
                  measured. Finally, the primary qubit state is
                  corrected on the basis of the ancillae measurement
                  outcome. We verify error correction by comparing the
                  corrected final state to the uncorrected state and
                  to the initial state. In principle, the approach
                  enables a quantum state to be maintained by means of

                  problems exponentially faster than classical
                  computers, but are challenging to build because of
                  their increased susceptibility to errors. However,
                  it is possible to detect and correct errors without
                  destroying coherence, by using quantum error
                  correcting codes1. The simplest of these are
                  three-quantum-bit (three-qubit) codes, which map a
                  one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state;
                  they can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip
                  error on one of the three qubits, depending on the
                  code used2. Here we demonstrate such phase- and
                  bit-flip error correcting codes in a superconducting
                  circuit. We encode a quantum state3, 4, induce
                  errors on the qubits and decode the error syndromeâ€”a
                  quantum state indicating which error has occurredâ€”by
                  reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is
                  then used as the input to a three-qubit gate that
                  corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the
                  code can recover from a single error on any qubit,
                  the fidelity of this process should decrease only
                  quadratically with error probability. We implement
                  the correcting three-qubit gate (known as a
                  conditional-conditional NOT, or Toffoli, gate) in 63
                  nanoseconds, using an interaction with the third
                  excited state of a single qubit. We find 85â€‰Â±â€‰1 per
                  cent fidelity to the expected classical action of
                  this gate, and 78â€‰Â±â€‰1 per cent fidelity to the ideal
                  quantum process matrix. Using this gate, we perform
                  a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip
                  error correction and demonstrate the predicted
                  first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenation
                  of these two codes in a nine-qubit device would
                  correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. In
                  combination with recent advances in superconducting
                  qubit coherence times5, 6, this could lead to
                  scalable quantum technology.}

                  and computation is to protect information-carrying
                  quantum states against undesired interactions with
                  the environment. To address this difficulty, many
                  good quantum error-correcting codes have been
                  derived as binary stabilizer codes. Fault-tolerant
                  quantum computation prompted the study of nonbinary
                  quantum codes, but the theory of such codes is not
                  as advanced as that of binary quantum codes. This
                  paper describes the basic theory of stabilizer codes
                  over finite fields. The relation between stabilizer
                  codes and general quantum codes is clarified by
                  introducing a Galois theory for these objects. A
                  characterization of nonbinary stabilizer codes over
                  Fq in terms of classical codes over Fq 2 is provided
                  that generalizes the well-known notion of additive
                  codes over F4 of the binary case. This paper also
                  derives lower and upper bounds on the minimum
                  distance of stabilizer codes, gives several code
                  constructions, and derives numerous families of
                  stabilizer codes, including quantum Hamming codes,
                  quadratic residue codes, quantum Melas codes,
                  quantum Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, and

                  and encoded unitary gates that can be implemented by
                  a constant-depth quantum circuit. Such gates have a
                  certain degree of protection since propagation of
                  errors in a constant-depth circuit is limited by a
                  constant size light cone. For the 2D geometry we
                  show that constant-depth circuits can only implement
                  a finite group of encoded gates known as the
                  Clifford group. This implies that topological
                  protection must be turned off for at least some
                  steps in the computation in order to achieve
                  universality. For the 3D geometry we show that an

                  is a tradeoff between fault-tolerantly implementable
                  logical gates and geometric locality of stabilizer
                  codes. They consider locality-preserving operations
                  which are implemented by a constant depth
                  geometrically local circuit and are thus
                  fault-tolerant by construction. In particular, they
                  shown that, for local stabilizer codes in D spatial
                  dimensions, locality preserving gates are restricted
                  to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of
                  the Clifford hierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate
                  this idea and provide several extensions and
                  applications of their characterization in various
                  directions. First, we present a new no-go theorem
                  for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we prove
                  that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with
                  a locality-preserving implementation of a
                  non-Clifford gate cannot have a macroscopic energy
                  barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of
                  a D-dimensional local stabilizer code with
                  non-trivial locality-preserving m-th level Clifford
                  logical gate is upper bounded by O(LD+1âˆ’m). For
                  codes with non-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves
                  the previous best bound by Bravyi and Terhal. Third
                  we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with
                  non-trivial transversal m-th level Clifford logical
                  gate is upper bounded by 1/m. As such, no family of
                  fault-tolerant codes with transversal gates in
                  increasing level of the Clifford hierarchy may
                  exist. This result applies to arbitrary stabilizer
                  and subsystem codes, and is not restricted to
                  geometrically-local codes. Fourth we extend the
                  result of Bravyi and K\"onig to subsystem codes. A
                  technical difficulty is that, unlike stabilizer
                  codes, the so-called union lemma does not apply to
                  subsystem codes. This problem is avoided by assuming
                  the presence of error threshold in a subsystem code,
                  and the same conclusion as Bravyi-K\"onig is
                  recovered.}

                  quantities have received considerable attention in
                  recent years. They emerge in several seemingly
                  unrelated fields, in the context of black hole

                  area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage
                  is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in
                  one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences
                  and similarities between bosonic and fermionic
                  models are stressed, area laws are related to the

                  nonequilibrium situations, and topological
                  entanglement entropies are discussed. These
                  questions are considered in classical and quantum
                  systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a
                  variety of correlation measures. A significant
                  proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative

                  topological order and the geometric entanglement, as
                  measured by the logarithm of the overlap between a
                  given state and its closest product state of
                  blocks. We do this for a variety of topologically
                  ordered systems such as the toric code, double
                  semion, colour code and quantum double models. As
                  happens for the entanglement entropy, we find that
                  for sufficiently large block sizes the geometric
                  entanglement is, up to possible sub-leading
                  corrections, the sum of two contributions: a bulk
                  contribution obeying a boundary law times the number
                  of blocks and a contribution quantifying the
                  underlying pattern of long-range entanglement of the
                  topologically ordered state. This topological
                  contribution is also present in the case of
                  single-spin blocks in most cases, and constitutes an
                  alternative characterization of topological order
                  for these quantum states based on a multipartite
                  entanglement measure. In particular, we see that the
                  topological term for the two-dimensional colour code
                  is twice as much as the one for the toric code, in
                  accordance with recent renormalization group
                  arguments (Bombin et al 2012 New J. Phys. 14
                  073048). Motivated by these results, we also derive
                  a general formalism to obtain upper- and
                  lower-bounds to the geometric entanglement of states
                  with a non-Abelian group symmetry, and which we
                  explicitly use to analyse quantum double
                  models. Furthermore, we also provide an analysis of
                  the robustness of the topological contribution in
                  terms of renormalization and perturbation theory
                  arguments, as well as a numerical estimation for
                  small systems. Some of the results in this paper
                  rely on the ability to disentangle single sites from
                  the quantum state, which is always possible for the
                  systems that we consider. Additionally we relate our
                  results to the behaviour of the relative entropy of
                  entanglement in topologically ordered systems, and
                  discuss a number of numerical approaches based on
                  tensor networks that could be employed to extract
                  this topological contribution for large systems
                  beyond exactly solvable models.}

                  state can be protected from environment-induced
                  error. If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently
                  reliable, errors are sparse and quantum error
                  correction (QEC) is capable of
                  identifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits
                  improves the preservation of states by guaranteeing
                  that increasingly larger clusters of errors will not
                  cause logical failureâ€”a key requirement for
                  large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the qubit
                  lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental
                  challenges in quantum computing. Here we report the
                  protection of classical states from environmental
                  bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of
                  these errors with increasing system size. We use a

                  towards the two-dimensional surface code QEC
                  scheme, and track errors as they occur by
                  repeatedly performing projective quantum
                  non-demolition parity measurements. Relative to a
                  single physical qubit, we reduce the failure rate in
                  retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 when
                  using five of our nine qubits and by a factor of 8.5
                  when using all nine qubits after eight
                  cycles. Additionally, we tomographically verify
                  preservation of the non-classical
                  Greenbergerâ€“Horneâ€“Zeilinger state. The successful
                  suppression of environment-induced errors will
                  motivate further research into the many challenges

                  transition in the former must have a precise
                  definition in terms of a quantum phase transition in
                  the latter. At the dynamical level, the transition
                  corresponds to a collapse of the excitation spectrum
                  at a critical point. At the static level, the
                  transition affects the ground-state wave function:
                  while in some cases it could be picked up by the
                  expectation value of a local operator, in others the
                  order may be nonlocal and impossible to be
                  determined with any local probe. Here we instead
                  propose to use concepts from quantum information

                  parameters, such as fidelity and entanglement

                  singularities in the fidelity susceptibility
                  translate directly into singularities in the heat
                  capacity of the classical system. In classical
                  glassy systems with an extensive number of
                  metastable states, we find that the prefactor of the
                  area law term in the entanglement entropy jumps
                  across the transition. We also discuss how
                  entanglement measures can be used to detect a
                  growing correlation length that diverges at the
                  transition. Finally, we illustrate how static order
                  can be hidden in systems with a macroscopically
                  large number of degenerate equilibrium states by
                  constructing a three-dimensional lattice gauge model

                  isometry from the bulk Hilbert space to the boundary

                  syndrome extraction circuits and correspondingly
                  largest thresholds. Defect-based logical encodings
                  of a new variety called twists have made it possible
                  to implement the full Clifford group without state
                  distillation. Here we investigate a patch-based
                  encoding involving a modified twist. In our modified
                  formulation, the resulting codes, called triangle
                  codes for the shape of their planar layout, have
                  only weight-four checks and relatively simple
                  syndrome extraction circuits that maintain a high,
                  near surface-code-level threshold. They also use 25
                  percent fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than
                  the surface code. Moreover, benefiting from the
                  twist, we can implement all Clifford gates by
                  lattice surgery without the need for state
                  distillation. By a surgical transformation to the
                  surface code, we also develop a scheme of doing all
                  Clifford gates on surface code patches in an
                  atypical planar layout, though with less qubit
                  efficiency than the triangle code. Finally, we
                  remark that logical qubits encoded in triangle codes
                  are naturally amenable to logical tomography, and
                  the smallest triangle code can demonstrate
                  high-pseudothreshold fault-tolerance to depolarizing

                  two-qubit states as a resource and distinguish all

                  probabilistic quantum cloning of a subset of
                  linearly dependent states. We show that a
                  linearly-independent subset of linearly-dependent
                  quantum states can be probabilistically cloned if
                  and only if any state in the subset cannot be
                  expressed as a linear superposition of the other
                  states in the set.  The optimal cloning efficiencies
                  are also investigated.",

                  mechanics and for quantum information science that
                  states an unknown quantum state cannot be cloned
                  perfectly. However, we can try to clone a quantum
                  state approximately with the optimal fidelity, or
                  instead, we can try to clone it perfectly with the
                  largest probability. Thus various quantum cloning
                  machines have been designed for different quantum
                  information protocols. Specifically, quantum cloning
                  machines can be designed to analyze the security of
                  quantum key distribution protocols such as BB84
                  protocol, six-state protocol, B92 protocol and their
                  generalizations. Some well-known quantum cloning
                  machines include universal quantum cloning machine,
                  phase-covariant cloning machine, the asymmetric
                  quantum cloning machine and the probabilistic
                  quantum cloning machine. In the past years, much
                  progress has been made in studying quantum cloning
                  machines and their applications and implementations,
                  both theoretically and experimentally. In this
                  review, we will give a complete description of those
                  important developments about quantum cloning and
                  some related topics. On the other hand, this review
                  is self-consistent, and in particular, we try to
                  present some detailed formulations so that further
                  study can be taken based on those results."

                  non-local CNOT operation using a three-qubit
                  entangled state. Firstly, we show how the non-local
                  CNOT operation can be implemented with unit fidelity
                  and unit probability by using a maximally entangled
                  GHZ state as controlled quantum channel. Then, we
                  put forward two schemes for conclusively
                  implementing the non-local operation with unit
                  fidelity by employing a partially entangled pure GHZ
                  state as quantum channel. The feature of these
                  schemes is that a third side is included, who may
                  participate the process of quantum non-local
                  implementation as a supervisor. Furthermore, when
                  the quantum channel is partially entangled, the
                  third one can rectify the state distorted by
                  imperfect quantum channel. In addition to the GHZ
                  class state, the W class state can also be used to
                  implement the same non-local operation
                  probabilistically. The probability of successful
                  implementation using the W class state is always
                  less than that using the GHZ class state.}

                  correcting physical errors using only a single round
                  of noisy check measurements, such that any residual
                  noise affects a small number of qubits. We establish
                  a general theory of single-shot error correction
                  where the crucial property is called good soundness
                  of the code's measurement checks. Good code
                  soundness in topological (or LDPC) codes is shown to
                  entail a macroscopic energy barrier for the
                  associated Hamiltonian. Consequently, 2D topological
                  codes with local checks can not have good
                  soundness. In tension with this, we also show that
                  for any code a specific choice of measurement checks
                  does exist that provides good soundness. In other
                  words, every code can perform single shot error
                  correction but the required checks may be nonlocal
                  and act on many qubits. If we desire codes with both
                  good soundness and simple measurement checks (the
                  LDPC property) then careful constructions are
                  needed. Finally, we use a double application of the
                  homological product to construct quantum LDPC codes
                  with single-shot error correcting capabilities. Our
                  double homological product codes exploit redundancy
                  in measurements checks through a process we call
                  metachecking. }

                  networks. By associating an integral capacity to
                  each edge and a tensor to each vertex in a flow
                  network, we can also interpret it as a tensor
                  network and, more specifically, as a linear map from
                  the input space to the output space. The quantum
                  max-flow is defined to be the maximal rank of this
                  linear map over all choices of tensors. The quantum
                  min-cut is defined to be the minimum product of the
                  capacities of edges over all cuts of the tensor
                  network. We show that unlike the classical case, the
                  quantum max-flow=min-cut conjecture is not true in
                  general. Under certain conditions, e.g., when the
                  capacity on each edge is some power of a fixed
                  integer, the quantum max-flow is proved to equal the
                  quantum min-cut. However, concrete examples are also
                  provided where the equality does not hold. We also
                  found connections of quantum max-flow/min-cut with
                  entropy of entanglement and the quantum
                  satisfiability problem. We speculate that the
                  phenomena revealed may be of interest both in spin
                  systems in condensed matter and in quantum gravity.}

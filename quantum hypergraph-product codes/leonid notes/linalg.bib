                  complete information about the set of all
                  nonnegative integer solutions of homogeneous and
                  inhomogeneous linear diophantine equations. Such
                  solutions are fundamental for
                  associative-commutative unification. Our algorithm
                  finds all minimal solutions as ``monotone'' paths in a
                  graph which encodes the linear diophantine
                  equation. This encoding makes repeated arithmetic
                  operations obsolete and allows inexpensive tests for
                  minimality of solutions. This graph algorithm
                  compares favourably with the known methods, namely
                  lexicogragraphic algorithm and completion
                  procedure. A \{PASCAL\} implementation can be found
                  in the Appendix. "

                  Euclidean flat Wilson loops, which are related to
                  minimal area surfaces in Euclidean AdS3 space. Using
                  known mathematical results for such minimal area
                  surfaces, we describe an infinite parameter family
                  of analytic solutions for closed Wilson loops. The
                  solutions are given in terms of Riemann theta
                  functions, and the validity of the equations of
                  motion is proven based on the trisecant
                  identity. The world sheet has the topology of a
                  disk, and the renormalized area is written as a
                  finite, one-dimensional contour integral over the
                  world-sheet boundary. An example is discussed in
                  detail with plots of the corresponding
                  surfaces. Further, for each Wilson loops we
                  explicitly construct a one parameter family of
                  deformations that preserve the area. The parameter
                  is the so-called spectral parameter.}

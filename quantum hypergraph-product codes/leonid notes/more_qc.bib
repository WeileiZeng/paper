                  by deriving tradeoff bounds for approximate quantum
                  error correcting codes. We introduce a notion of
                  local approximate correctability and code distance,
                  and give a number of equivalent formulations
                  thereof, generalizing various exact error-correction
                  criteria. Our tradeoff bounds relate the number of
                  physical qubits n, the number of encoded qubits k,
                  the code distance d, the accuracy parameter δ that
                  quantifies how well the erasure channel can be
                  reversed, and the locality parameter ℓ that
                  specifies the length scale at which the recovery
                  operation can be done. In a regime where the
                  recovery is successful to accuracy ϵ that is
                  exponentially small in ℓ, which is the case for
                  perturbations of local commuting projector codes,
                  our bound reads kd2D−1≤O(n(logn)2DD−1) for codes on
                  D-dimensional lattices of Euclidean metric. We also
                  find that the code distance of any local approximate
                  code cannot exceed O(ℓn(D−1)/D) if δ≤O(ℓn−1/D). As a
                  corollary of our formulation of correctability in
                  terms of logical operator avoidance, we show that
                  the code distance d and the size d~ of a minimal
                  region that can support all approximate logical
                  operators satisfies d~d1D−1≤O(nℓDD−1), where the
                  logical operators are accurate up to O((nδ/d)1/2) in
                  operator norm. Finally, we prove that for
                  two-dimensional systems if logical operators can be
                  approximated by operators supported on
                  constant-width flexible strings, then the dimension
                  of the code space must be bounded. This supports one
                  of the assumptions of algebraic anyon theories, that
                  there exist only finitely many anyon types. }

                  of quantum mechanics might speed up certain
                  computations dramatically. Interest in quantum
                  computation has since been growing. One of the main
                  difficulties of realizing quantum computation is
                  that decoherence tends to destroy the information in
                  a superposition of states in a quantum computer,
                  thus making long computations impossible. A futher
                  difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state
                  transformations throughout the computation
                  accumulate, rendering the output of long
                  computations unreliable. It was previously known
                  that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate
                  O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per
                  gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t
                  gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum
                  circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t)^c) amounts of
                  inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some
                  constant c. We do this by showing how to compute
                  using quantum error correcting codes. These codes
                  were previously known to provide resistance to
                  errors while storing and transmitting quantum
                  data.},

                  memory can be stored reliably for a macroscopic time

                  memory is put in contact with a cold enough thermal
                  bath. In this paper we derive a rigorous lower bound

                  model which was recently conjectured to have a
                  self-correcting behavior. Assuming that dynamics of
                  the memory system can be described by a Markovian
                  master equation of Davies form, we prove that
                  $T_{mem}\ge L^{c\beta}$ for some constant $c>0$,
                  where $L$ is the lattice size and $\beta$ is the

                  with a noiseless syndrome extraction. First, we show

                  is the number of code qubits. Our implementation
                  uses a reduction from MLD to simulation of matchgate
                  quantum circuits. This reduction however requires a
                  special noise model with independent bit-flip and
                  phase-flip errors. Secondly, we show how to
                  implement MLD approximately for more general noise
                  models using matrix product states (MPS). Our

                  contraction. We benchmark the MPS-based decoder

                  important tool in quantum error correction as it
                  allows the decoder to adapt to the error
                  distribution of a quantum chip. An additional
                  motivation for using neural networks is the fact
                  that they can be evaluated by dedicated hardware
                  which is very fast and consumes little
                  power. Machine learning has been previously applied
                  to decode the surface code. However, these
                  approaches are not scalable as the training has to
                  be redone for every system size which becomes
                  increasingly difficult. In this work the existence
                  of local decoders for higher dimensional codes leads
                  us to use a low-depth convolutional neural network
                  to locally assign a likelihood of error on each
                  qubit. For noiseless syndrome measurements,
                  numerical simulations show that the decoder has a
                  threshold of around 7.1\% when applied to the 4D
                  toric code. When the syndrome measurements are
                  noisy, the decoder performs better for larger code
                  sizes when the error probability is low. We also
                  give theoretical and numerical analysis to show how
                  a convolutional neural network is different from the
                  1-nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a baseline

                  detected by measuring certain check operators which
                  yield an error syndrome, and the decoding problem
                  consists of determining the most likely recovery
                  given the syndrome. The corresponding classical
                  problem is known to be NP-complete, and a similar

                  in the surface code, since it is of low runtime
                  complexity and achieves relatively low logical error
                  rates [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 180501 (2012)]. A
                  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
                  [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 160503 (2012)] is able to
                  achieve lower logical error rates and higher
                  thresholds than MWPM, but requires a classical
                  runtime complexity which is super-polynomial in L,
                  the linear size of the code. In this work we present
                  an MCMC algorithm that achieves significantly lower
                  logical error rates than MWPM at the cost of a
                  polynomially increased classical runtime
                  complexity. For error rates p close to the
                  threshold, our algorithm needs a runtime complexity
                  which is increased by O(L^2) relative to MWPM in
                  order to achieve a lower logical error rate. If p is
                  below an L-dependent critical value, no increase in
                  the runtime complexity is necessary any longer. For
                  p->0, the logical error rate achieved by our
                  algorithm is exponentially smaller (in L) than that
                  of MWPM, without requiring an increased runtime
                  complexity. Our algorithm allows for trade-offs
                  between runtime and achieved logical error rates as
                  well as for parallelization, and can be also used to
                  correct in the case of imperfect stabilizer

                  information processing. The spin-up and spin-down
                  states of a single electron or hole, trapped inside
                  a quantum dot, can represent a single qubit with a
                  reasonably long decoherence time. The spin qubit can
                  be optically coupled to excited (charged exciton)
                  states that are also trapped in the quantum dot,
                  which provides a mechanism to quickly initialize,
                  manipulate and measure the spin state with optical
                  pulses, and to interface between a stationary matter
                  qubit and a ‘flying’ photonic qubit for quantum
                  communication and distributed quantum information
                  processing. The interaction of the spin qubit with
                  light may be enhanced by placing the quantum dot
                  inside a monolithic microcavity. An entire system,
                  consisting of a two-dimensional array of quantum
                  dots and a planar microcavity, may plausibly be
                  constructed by modern semiconductor nano-fabrication
                  technology and could offer a path toward chip-sized
                  scalable quantum repeaters and quantum
                  computers. This article reviews the recent
                  experimental developments in optical control of
                  single quantum dot spins for quantum information
                  processing. We highlight demonstrations of a
                  complete set of all-optical single-qubit operations
                  on a single quantum dot spin: initialization, an
                  arbitrary SU(2) gate, and measurement. We review the
                  decoherence and dephasing mechanisms due to
                  hyperfine interaction with the nuclear-spin bath,
                  and show how the single-qubit operations can be
                  combined to perform spin echo sequences that extend
                  the qubit decoherence from a few nanoseconds to
                  several microseconds, more than 5 orders of
                  magnitude longer than the single-qubit gate
                  time. Two-qubit coupling is discussed, both within a
                  single chip by means of exchange coupling of nearby
                  spins and optically induced geometric phases, as
                  well as over longer-distances. Long-distance
                  spin–spin entanglement can be generated if each spin
                  can emit a photon that is entangled with the spin,
                  and these photons are then interfered. We review
                  recent work demonstrating entanglement between a
                  stationary spin qubit and a flying photonic
                  qubit. These experiments utilize the polarization-
                  and frequency-dependent spontaneous emission from
                  the lowest charged exciton state to single spin
                  Zeeman sublevels.}

                  the resources needed to actually perform a
                  fault-tolerant computation are daunting. In
                  principle, it may be possible to reduce this

                  significantly higher rates. Logical gates can be
                  done in such a scheme by teleporting the logical
                  qubits between code blocks. Logical teleportation
                  can be done fault-tolerantly by measuring a
                  particular set of logical operators. This
                  measurement involves preparing an entangled
                  ancillary state and doing a transversal circuit
                  between the codeword and the ancilla. We study this
                  procedure, and show that a wide range of such
                  measurement protocols exist. There is a trade-off
                  between the size of of the ancilla and the
                  robustness against errors; for a large codeword, it
                  may be fruitful to use a larger ancilla that has
                  greater error-correcting power.}

                  of the d-dimensional toric code which are attached
                  along a 
                  {$(d-1)$} -dimensional boundary. In particular, for
                  d = 2, we show that the (triangular) color code with
                  boundaries is equivalent to the (folded) toric code
                  with boundaries. We also find that the d
                  -dimensional toric code admits logical non-Pauli
                  gates from the d th level of the Clifford hierarchy,
                  and thus saturates the bound by Bravyi and König. In
                  particular, we show that the logical d -qubit
                  control- Z gate can be fault-tolerantly implemented
                  on the stack of d copies of the toric code by a
                  local unitary transformation.}

                  for fault-tolerant quantum computing, such as
                  protected quantum gates with relatively low overhead
                  and robustness against imperfect measurement of
                  error syndromes. Here we investigate the storage
                  threshold error rates for bit-flip and phase-flip
                  noise in the 3D color code on the body-centererd
                  cubic lattice, assuming perfect syndrome
                  measurements. In particular, by exploiting a
                  connection between error correction and statistical
                  mechanics, we estimate the threshold for 1D
                  string-like and 2D sheet-like logical operators to
                  be [Math Processing Error] and [Math Processing
                  Error]. We obtain these results by using parallel
                  tempering Monte Carlo simulations to study the
                  disorder-temperature phase diagrams of two new 3D
                  statistical-mechanical models: the 4- and 6-body
                  random coupling Ising models. }
